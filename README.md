As opposed to previously spotted attacks such as the Flubot Trojan that steals sensitive data from devices by injecting code and displaying overlay screens, the malicious applications presented in this research rely on social engineering to lure victims into handing over their credit cards details. The modus operandi is always the same. The victims receive a legitimate-looking SMS with a link to a phishing page that is impersonating government services, and lures them to download a malicious Android application and then pay a small fee for the service. The malicious application not only collects the victim’s credit card numbers, but also gains access to their 2FA authentication SMS, and turn the victim’s device into a bot capable of spreading similar phishing SMS to other potential victims. 


This article describes technical details about how these campaigns are constructed, their business model, and how they became so successful despite utilizing unsophisticated tools. In addition, the investigation shows that due to the attackers’ own low OPSEC (operations security) level, the victims’ data is not protected and is freely accessible to third parties.

The attackers are still thriving and continue to update their malicious applications and underlying infrastructure on almost a daily basis.
